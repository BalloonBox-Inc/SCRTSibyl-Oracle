## About :mailbox_with_mail:

This documentation contains all APIs endpoints featured in our SCRTsibyl DApp.

Imagine you are a user who owns a Keplr wallet and wants to be issued a micro-loan.
The SCRTsibyl DApp leverages public APIs to allow users to:

- integrate their existing Plaid and Coinbase accounts with the SCRTsibyl Credit Score model,
- undergo a credit score check,
- validate their credibility to lenders issuing them a loan.

When using the SCRTsibyl API you agree with our [Terms and Conditions](https://) :copyright:.

## To Notice :eyes:

#### Help Us

The API is in active development and we are changing things rapdily. Once we are ready to release a stable version of API we will notify the existing API owners.
