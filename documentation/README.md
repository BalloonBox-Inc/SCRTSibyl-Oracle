This documentation contains all APIs endpoints featured in our SCRTSibyl Dapp.

Imagine you are a user who owns a Keplr wallet and wants to be issued a micro-loan.
Public APIs allow users to:
+ integrate their existing Plaid and Coinbase accounts with the SCRTSibyl Credit Score model, 
+ undergo a credit score check,
+ validate their credibility to lenders issuing them a loan. 

When using the SCRTSibyl API you agree with our [Terms and Conditions](https://) :copyright:.
