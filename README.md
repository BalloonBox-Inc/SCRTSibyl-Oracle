‚ö°Ô∏è This is the *credit score algorithm* Repo for our SCRTSibyl oracle. 

## At a Glance
SCRTSibyl is an oracle for credit score checks developed for the Secret Network. Our oracle returns a numerical, private, and encrypted credit score affirming users' credibility and trustworthiness within the Secret network ecosystem. We designed this dapp with one specific use case in mind: P2P micro-lending, which is facilitating lending and borrowing of microloans ranging between $1-25K USD. Running a credit score check on a user you are considering lending money to or borrowing money from, will inform you whether and how much a user can pay back upon loan issuance. 

The dapp works as follow: 
 - it acquires user's financial data by integrating with two validators ([Plaid](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview) & [Coinbase](https://developers.coinbase.com/))
 - it runs an algorithm on given data to compute a score representing the financial health of a user
 - it writes the score to the Secret blockchain via a CosmWasm smart contract
 - it makes the score available to service providers (i.e., loan issuers) by releasing permission/viewing Secret keys. 

Ultimately, this will incentivize on-chain traffic, it will affirm the reputation of those users requesting a credit score, and it will execute a credit score check to validate their credibility, while also preserving their privacy. 




## Executing Locally :shipit:
 - download or clone the repo to your machine
 - install dependancies 
 - set up ```.env``` file 
 - execute 


#### Package Manager Required
npm or yarn


Run in local terminal following command:
```
git clone  ... my-project-name
cd my-project-name
yarn install
```


#### Credentials Required :old_key: :lock:

You'll need to create a Developer Coinmarket Cap API Key, following the CoinMarketCap Developers guide [here.](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Introduction)

Next, create a ```.env``` local file in your root folder: 

```
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PLAID_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sandbox_key
PLAID_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_unique_access_token
PLAID_URL_SANDBOX="sandbox.plaid.com"

COINBASE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_Id
COINBASE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

COINMARKETCAP_KEY=your_coinmarketcap_key
```




## Credit Score Model 

#### Algorithm Architecture :page_facing_up:
Undertsand the credit score model at a glance. 

We developed two distinct models, one for each of our chosen validators, namely Plaid & Coinbase.

 -  :dollar: credit score model for [**Plaid**](./images/logic_plaid.png) 

 -  :moneybag: credit score model for[** Coinbase**](./images/logic_coinbase.png) 

#### Features
Plaid model highlights
- :fire: fetch 5 yrs transaction history in < 1 second
- :dark_sunglasses: select dynamically user's best credit card products
- :dart: smart detection of recurring deposits and withdrawals (monthly)
- :chart: linear regression on minimum running balance past 24 months
- :anchor: auto-filter & discard micro transactions
- :magnet: inspect loan, investment, saving accounts

Coinbase model highlight
- :key: check for user KYC status
- :atom_symbol: live fetch of top 20 cryptos via [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) API
- :gem: dynamic selection of user's best crypto wallets
- :safety_pin: real-time automatic conversion of any currency to USD
- :satellite: analyze all transactions since Coinbase account inception
- :hammer_and_wrench: smart user's net profit calculator
